# The Shadow War: Sri Lanka's Drug Crisis (2018‚Äì2025)

**A Scrollytelling Data Story on Arrests, Seizures, and Treatment**

This repository contains the source code for an interactive data story that visualises and analyses Sri Lanka's ongoing drug crisis from **2018 to 2025**.

The project uses a **scrollytelling** format to guide the reader through key findings, policy shifts, and geographic disparities in the national response, highlighting the critical imbalance between law enforcement and public health support.
