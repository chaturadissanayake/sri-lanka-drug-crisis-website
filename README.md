This is a request to synthesise a `README.md` file from a collection of web development source files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`).

The project is a **scrollytelling data story** titled "**The Shadow War: Sri Lanka's Drug Crisis (2018‚Äì2025)**." The README should cover the project's purpose, features, technology stack, setup instructions, and citation information, as derived from the code.

Here is the generated `README.md`:

# The Shadow War: Sri Lanka's Drug Crisis (2018‚Äì2025)

**A Scrollytelling Data Story on Arrests, Seizures, and Treatment**

This repository contains the source code for an interactive data story that visualises and analyses Sri Lanka's ongoing drug crisis from 2018 to 2025. The project is designed using a **scrollytelling** format to guide the reader through key findings, policy shifts, and geographic disparities in the national response, highlighting the critical imbalance between law enforcement and public health support.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Scrollytelling Format:** A modern, immersive narrative experience where the story unfolds as the user scrolls, featuring distinct steps tied to data visualisations.
* **Dual-Theme Support (Dark/Light Mode):** Users can easily toggle between a refined dark theme (default) and a light theme using a dedicated button.
* **Dynamic Data Visualisations:** Integration points for six key charts that become visible upon scrolling, covering topics like Arrests vs. Treatment, Shifting Substance Trends (Methamphetamine rise), Seizures, Rehabilitation Capacity, Policy Timelines, and Geographic Distribution.
* **Persistent Scroll Progress Bar:** A thin bar at the top of the viewport to indicate reading progress.
* **News Ticker:** A continuously scrolling banner for high-level updates and key facts.
* **Side Navigation:** A fixed dot-navigation bar that allows readers to jump between story sections and shows the current step.
* **Image Lightbox:** A feature to enlarge and view data visualisations or images in a modal.
* **Interactive Citation:** Provides easy copy functionality for **Journalistic**, **APA Style**, and **BibTeX** citation formats.
* **Accessibility & Interactivity:** Includes keyboard shortcuts (`Shift + ?` to view shortcuts, `T` to toggle theme, `Esc` to close modals).

## üíª Tech Stack

The project is a pure front-end application built with modern web standards:

* **HTML5:** Structure and content organisation.
* **CSS3:** Styled using **CSS Variables (Design Tokens)** for easy theming and a consistent design language.
* **Vanilla JavaScript (`app.js`):** Powers all interactive features (scrollytelling logic, Intersection Observer for animations, theme toggle, lightbox, copy-to-clipboard, keyboard shortcuts, etc.).
* **Fonts:** Uses **Inter** (for body text) and **Playfair Display** (for headlines) for a strong visual hierarchy.
